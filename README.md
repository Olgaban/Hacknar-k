# Hacknarok
Hacknar√∂k hackathon in KPT.
## Inspiration
The inspiration were recent events in the East, and overall lack of communication channels in places were connectivity is a big issue (e.g. damaged cities, underground and remote localizations).
## What it does
The applications uses devices supporting Bluetooth connection, as nodes in Bluetooth Low Energy mesh. Once the message is received it is being continuously advertised over a specified period to all nearby devices through EddyStone Beacon (it spreads like a virus). Bluetooth range is not a problem in that case, because the message is being advertised constantly, as the user moves and encounters other app users.
## How we built it
We built our application using variety of python libraries like Bleak, Kivy and Beacontools These libraries were essential to establish a BLE Beacon and provide a communication with BLE devices.
## Challenges we ran into
The main challenges were to find an appropriate tools for our problem. As it turns out the problem is very unique and lack of documentation and code examples was a very big issue.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of making up using technologies that we have never been familiar with. And proving that our concept is realistic and achievable in 24 hours of coding
## What we learned
We have learned to tackle with Bluetooth Low Energy technology. Moreover we have developed a team spirit. And most importantly that every goal is achievable if we work together and believe in our success.
## What's next for OG WARning
Next steps for our team is going to be deployment for Mobile platforms and expanding app's functionalities like user authentication and message encryption. In addition we would like to allow users to send directed messages
## Technologies we used
beacontools, bleak, bluetooth, kivy, python
